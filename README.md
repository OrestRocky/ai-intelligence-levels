AI Types: ANI, AGI, ASI

This repository explores the theoretical and mathematical foundations of Artificial Intelligence types:

- **ANI** — Artificial Narrow Intelligence
- **AGI** — Artificial General Intelligence
- **ASI** — Artificial Superintelligence

It serves as an educational framework for understanding the cognitive evolution from narrow tools to superintelligent systems through code, formulas, and conceptual models.

1. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is often grouped into three conceptual types based on its capabilities:

- **ANI** is task-specific, pattern-based intelligence.
- **AGI** generalizes learning across domains — closer to human cognition.
- **ASI** is a hypothetical entity that surpasses human-level reasoning, learning, and creativity.

This project aims to describe each level using mathematical notation and minimal code examples.

2. Mathematical Foundations

ANI — Artificial Narrow Intelligence

A narrow AI is typically represented as a function trained for a specific domain:

```math
f(x) = y,
```

Where:
- \( x \): input (image, text, etc.)
- \( y \): predicted output
- \( f \): model trained on domain-specific data

These models do not generalize to new contexts.

Example in Python:
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

AGI — Artificial General Intelligence

AGI requires meta-learning capabilities:

```math
M(f_i) \Rightarrow f_j,
```

Where:
- \( f_i \): function for task i
- \( f_j \): function for task j
- \( M \): meta-model that transforms or generalizes across tasks

AGI should dynamically create or adapt models:

```python
def meta_learn(task_data):
    model = initialize_model()
    model.train(task_data)
    return model
```

AGI agents must also exhibit:
- Context transfer
- Long-term planning
- Dynamic memory

---

ASI — Artificial Superintelligence

ASI operates recursively and improves itself beyond human capabilities:

```math
f_{t+1} = G(f_t),
```

Where:
- \( f_t \): current model at time t
- \( G \): generator or evolver function

This assumes:
- No fixed limits on compute or memory
- Ability to create new learning architectures
